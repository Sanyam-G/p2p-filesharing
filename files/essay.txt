TITLE: Predicting the Next Major Advancement in AI and Its Societal Impact

Artificial intelligence (AI) is advancing rapidly and changing how people learn. In the next two years, I predict that AI will significantly improve exam preparation through personalized learning tools. These AI systems will create practice tests, adjust learning material to fit each student, and provide targeted feedback to help them succeed.

Research shows that AI is already capable of such advancements. Bubeck et al. (2023) found that GPT-4 can solve complex problems and perform better than most human candidates in mock technical interviews. They explain, “GPT-4 passes mock technical interviews on LeetCode... beating 93% to 100% of human candidates” (p. 9). Similarly, Haruna-Cooper and Rashid (2023) highlight that GPT-4 can generate and grade exam questions. It even reached the passing level for the United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE).

Using AI for exam preparation comes with both benefits and challenges. The AI100 Report (Littman et al., 2021) mentions that people have mixed feelings about AI, often due to concerns about bias and fairness. The report states, “Media coverage of AI often distorts and exaggerates AI’s potential... but it has helped to raise public awareness of legitimate concerns” (p. 6). Addressing these concerns will be essential to building trust in AI-driven educational tools.

One key advantage of these tools is their ability to provide customized study plans. The AI100 Report emphasizes that AI is becoming more integrated into daily life and improving education access (p. 12). Personalized AI systems can adjust content difficulty based on student performance, offering more effective learning experiences.

However, AI tools need to be transparent. Haenlein and Kaplan (2019) warn that “Deep Learning... is inherently a black box... understanding how recommendations have been derived becomes critical” (p. 11). Haruna-Cooper and Rashid (2023) add that while GPT-4 can provide consistent feedback, it may reflect biases from the data it was trained on. Both students and teachers need clear explanations of how AI feedback is generated to foster trust.

These advancements could also help reduce educational inequality. By providing continuous feedback and personalized support, AI can assist students who may not have access to other high-quality learning resources. Nevertheless, Haenlein and Kaplan (2019) stress the need for global standards to ensure that AI systems are fair and safe (p. 12).

Despite these challenges, the benefits are significant. AI-driven tools can improve academic performance and reduce the stress of exam preparation. By combining AI’s strengths in data analysis with human guidance, these tools can offer effective, personalized learning experiences. Both Bubeck et al. (2023) and Haruna-Cooper and Rashid (2023) demonstrate that AI is capable of handling complex tasks, supporting the vision of advanced exam preparation systems.

In conclusion, the next major AI development will be personalized exam preparation tools that enhance learning and accessibility. Addressing transparency and ethical concerns will be key to gaining trust and widespread adoption. If implemented correctly, AI has the potential to transform education and empower students around the world.
